# HALE Studio

HALE Studio aims to enable users to set up a harmonization workflow on datasets from a local model to a common model, such as INSPIRE. The user interface presents the model of the source dataset (derived from database) on the left and the target model on the right (derived from xml schema). Conversion rules are defined by selecting similar properties on both sides.

The open source software has been developed in the scope of a European Research project, HUMBOLDT (2006) and is currently maintained by a company called [WeTransform](https://wetransform.to) in Darmstad Germany. WeTransform hosts the Hale Studio [user guide](http://help.halestudio.org/latest) and a [user forum](https://discuss.wetransform.to). The Git repository for Hale Studio is at https://github.com/halestudio/hale, which also hosts [installers for windows, linux and apple](https://github.com/halestudio/hale/releases/tag/4.1.0).
