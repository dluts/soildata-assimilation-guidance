# Hale Connect

A Software as a Service solution provided by [wetransform](https://wetransform.to) to provide view and download services with metadata for rich datasets, 
such as those following the INSPIRE data models. Transformations are prepared in Hale Studio and effectuated in the Hale Connect platform.

The services are  optimised for ease of use and performance, due to the cloud native setup of the data services. A data space connector is in preparation.
