# FROST server

Frost is an open source server implementation of [OGC Sensorthings](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings), a modern data exchange standard for Sensor Data. 
Because the INSPIRE Soil model is based on [Observations and Measurements](https://www.ogc.org/standards/om), the Sensorthings API can be used 
to provide Soil related data download services. Sensorthings API is generally easier to set up for administrators and easier to consume by 
clients then INSPIRE Soil data via WFS.
