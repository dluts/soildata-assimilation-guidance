# Masterclass on Soil Data Assimilation

At jan 24-26 2023 WENR & ISRIC are organising a masterclass on Soil Data Assimilation.

The general design of the masterclass is to set up workgroups around certain topics, which self organise to set some goals for the masterclass and try to achieve the goals.
Every day starts with a general kick-off and closing to report on aims and progress. A selection of content experts is available which circulate between the groups.
