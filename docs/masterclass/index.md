# Masterclass on Soil Data Assimilation

At jan 24-26 2023 WENR & ISRIC are organising a masterclass on Soil Data Assimilation.

The general design of the masterclass is to set up workgroups around certain topics, which self organise to set some goals for the masterclass and try to achieve the goals.
Every day starts with a general kick-off and closing to report on aims and progress. A selection of content experts is available which circulate between the groups.

## Q&A channel

During the masterclass questions can be placed in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ejpsoil/soildata-assimilation-guidance). Note that it may take some time to respond, for urgent matters, use alternative channels.

## Focus groups

Participants cluster in focus groups around a certain topic or technology. Initial groups are formed in the welcome ceremony. Here are some suggestions:

- Carbon stock (Sample dataset: [Dutch BRH-P](../cookbook/data/bhr-p/readme))
- Soil biology & quality
- Grids, Soilmaps, WCS ([SoilGrids](https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/data_aggregated/1000m/soc/) [COG format](https://www.cogeo.org/))
- Soil profile databases, lab results & spectroscopy
- Agriculture
- Sensorthings, O&M
- GeoPython
- Governance aspects (open data, security, EU requirements)
- Semantic web, GLOSIS, SKOS
- Dataspaces

For each group a wiki, chat and jitsy are listed below.
