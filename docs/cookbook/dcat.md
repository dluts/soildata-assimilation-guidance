# DCAT

[DCAT](https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat) is an ontology from W3C to describe datasets in the semantic web. It is supported by software such as CKAN, GeoNetwork.
The [geodcat-ap]() group has developed a specialisation of DCAT v1 to describe spatial datasets. Many of the conventions of geodcat-ap have
been introduced in follow-up editions of DCAT (v2, v3).
